/* OOPs:
* It is a programming paradigm consisting of main features
* 1) Inheritance
* 2) Polymorphism
* 3) Abstraction
* 4) Encapsulation
*
*
* Inheritance:
* 	The concept of inheritance in java means that acquiring properties from one class to another.
* 	ex: Car -> Breaks, number of Wheels, engine, mirrors, petrol/diesel/cng/ electric.
* 	maruti suzuki -> Breaks, number of Wheels, engine, mirrors, petrol/diesel/cng/ electric.
* 	+ Brand name, models, colors.
*
* In java we use extend keyword to define parent child relationship.
* Multiple Inheritance is not allowed in java
* Multi-level Inheritance is allowed in java.
*  
* Polymorphism:
* 	Multiple or many forms. 
* 	One object or methods with multiple forms. 
* 	There are two ways the polymorphism can be achieved in java:
* 		a. Compile Time - Static Polymorphism. 
* 			eg - Method overloading. 
* 		b. Run Time - Dynamic Polymorphism. 
* 			eg- Method overriding.  
* 	
* 	Method Overriding(Run time polymorphism) -> 
* 		If a child class has a same method as declared in parent class java gives the preference to 
* 		method present in child class which is called as over riding. 
* 		Same name and same number of parameters.
* 	
* 	Super Keyword - It is a reference variable used to refer to the immediate parent class. 
* 	
* 	Method Overloading(Compile Time Polymorphism) ->
* 		Methods with same name but with different number of parameters. 
* 
* There are two ways to achieve method overriding->
* 	a. Different number of parameters.
* 	b. Different data types of parameters.
